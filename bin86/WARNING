	The S86/SLD tool chain contained in this directory is a
	work in (slow) progress. It was originally designed as a
	native 16-bit, DOS-hosted tool chain, and has then been
	hacked to serve as a cross compiler back end hosted on
	a 32-bit (or 64-bit) system. It no longer runs in 16-bit
	environments.

	Expect lots of bugs!

	Do not try to compile this with anything but SubC (or
	at least make sure that char is unsigned and CHAR_MAX
	is 255).

	Run "make all" to compile S86/SLD and related tools.
